One entry per iteration: hypothesis → reasoning → test → result → next.

## 2026-10-26 — Phase 1 survey (summary)
Broad survey by parallel workers. Outcome: the classical families are ruled out (see `PLAN.md` "Where we are", `hypotheses/ruled_out.md`, `findings/`). Main lesson: what remains cannot be tested by the cribs without a specific key hypothesis, so from here on the work is one hypothesis at a time.

## 2026-10-27 — Iteration 1: separable grid key
- **Hypothesis:** the key depends only on where each letter sits in a grid: k = f(row) + g(col) mod 26, width w, start offset o, fixed tableau (Vigenère / Beaufort / variant Beaufort, AZ or KRYPTOS alphabet).
- **Why:** Sanborn's "visual systems for encoding" (Wired 2005); the width-7/21 anomalies; the NSA's "interval 7". A grid key is a simple hand method that would produce exactly that kind of column signal.
- **Test:** an exact consistency check. Each crib key value links one row to one column, and the key is consistent only if every cycle in that graph sums to 0 mod 26. Script: `iterations/it01_grid_key.py`. Widths 2–48, every offset, 6 tableaux. 1,034 (w,o) configurations per tableau contain at least one cycle, so the test can decide them.
- **Control:** a key planted at w=21, o=5 on English text was recovered.
- **Result:** 0 consistent configurations for K4. **Refuted** for w ≤ 48 under fixed tableaux. Random ciphertexts give 0 hits 40% of the time (mean 15), so K4's 0 is not anomalous in itself; the refutation stands because the true configuration would have to pass.
- **Not covered:** unknown mixed alphabets; widths ≥ 49 (too few cycles to test).
- **Next:** hypothesis 2, the structure of the known KRYPTOS-alphabet key letters.

## 2026-10-27 — Iteration 2: structure in the known key letters
- **Hypothesis:** if K4 uses a standard tableau (AZ or KRYPTOS alphabet; Vigenère, Beaufort or variant), the 24 key letters at the cribs show a simple generating rule, such as an arithmetic progression or alphabet runs.
- **Key letters:** Vig/KA `RDUMRIYWOYNKY` / `ELYOIECBAQK`. Visible features: a 3-letter alphabet run (`CBA` under Vig/KA, `LMN` under variant Beaufort/KA, both at positions 70–72) and `KKK` under Beaufort/AZ at positions 31–33.
- **Test:** look-elsewhere control. Compute the same features (the longest run of equal successive differences, and the number of ±1 runs) for 20,000 random ciphertexts across all tableaux.
- **Result:** the longest run is P=0.95 and the ±1 runs are P=0.21. Both are chance-level, so there is **no internal structure**. This agrees with phase 1 (w-crib): under a standard tableau the key looks random, so it is not a progression or an alphabet walk.
- **Next:** hypothesis 3, a concrete hand system behind Sanborn's "matrix codes Ed gave me".
